    title: Our guiding principles
    text: |
      ## Singular Worth

      **Always remembering the distinctive qualities that make each one of us irreplaceable.**

       At the Common Humanity Coalition, we believe that every individual possesses an inherent and singular worth. We are dedicated to celebrating the unique talents, perspectives and life experiences that make each person irreplaceable. By honouring the multitude of human expression, we create an environment where all feel empowered to be who they are, achieve their potential and contribute to the richness of our collective journey.

      ## Understanding

      **Fostering the meeting of hearts and minds, we want to inspire a culture of learning and connection that bridges differences.**

      Central to our mission is cultivating deeper understanding between all Canadians. Through respectful dialogue and genuine empathy, we create spaces where people can share their unique perspectives while discovering their common ground. By celebrating both our differences and our shared experiences, we work to build a society where understanding bridges divides and strengthens our collective bonds.

      ## Common Humanity

      **We dedicate ourselves to bringing our shared experiences to the fore, uniting Canadians through common aspirations, nurturing a sense of our collective human journey.**

      At the heart of the Common Humanity Coalition is a reverence for the universal experiences that bind us all together as human beings. Whether it is the joy of love, the pain of loss, or the pursuit of purpose, we are united by the common threads that run through the tapestry of the human experience. By honouring these shared aspirations, we foster a sense of connection that transcends individual differences and inspires us to work together towards a better future.

    title: What we do
    text: |
      At the Common Humanity Coalition, our work spans a range of initiatives aimed at bringing our principles to life in Canadian institutions.

      **Inform the public** by doing research, tracking policies and gathering information so Canadians are aware of the extent to which governments, workplaces and school boards, are aligned with our guiding principles.

      **Change policies** by mobilizing coalition members and the public at large to advocate for policies and practices that make institutions more reflective of our principles of honouring individuality, fostering understanding, and celebrating our common humanity.

      **Empower communities** by providing resources, training and support to help local chapters implement initiatives that bring our vision to life in their neighbourhoods, towns and cities. This grassroots approach ensures our work is responsive to local community needs.

      This multifaceted approach allows us to drive meaningful, lasting change - one person, one community, and one institution at a time.

    title: How we do it
    text: |
      **Lead by example** At the Common Humanity Coalition, we believe in embodying the principles we stand for. In all our interactions, initiatives, and operations, we strive to model the understanding, respect for individuality, and celebration of our shared humanity that we wish to see reflected across society. By consistently living our values, we inspire others to embrace these principles in their own lives and communities.
      
      **Offer a vision for a better future** We are driven by a compelling vision of a society where every person's unique worth is cherished, where differences are bridged through understanding, and where our common humanity forms the bedrock of thriving communities. By articulating this inspiring vision, we rally Canadians to join us in working towards a better future for all.
      
      **Work with those that agree, listen closely to those that do not** We actively seek out and collaborate with individuals and organizations who share our principles, leveraging our collective strengths to drive meaningful change. At the same time, we are committed to engaging respectfully with those who hold different views. By listening closely to their perspectives, we foster dialogue, find common ground, and build bridges of understanding.
      
      **Stay curious, be humble, keep an open mind** As an organization, we embrace a spirit of continuous learning and growth. We stay curious about the evolving needs and experiences of Canadians, humbly acknowledging that we don't have all the answers. By keeping an open mind, we create opportunities for new insights, innovative solutions, and the wisdom of different voices to shape our work. This approach ensures we remain responsive and relevant in our efforts to build a society that works for everyone.
