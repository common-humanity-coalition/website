    title: Our guiding principles
    text: |
      ## Singular Worth

      **Every person possesses inherent dignity as an individual, deserving recognition based on their unique qualities.**

      At the Common Humanity Coalition, we champion the intrinsic value of each person as an individual. We advocate for institutions that evaluate people based on their character, abilities, and demonstrated needs—never reducing them to demographic categories. By promoting systems where advancement is based on merit and support is based on individual circumstances, we work to create a society where each person's autonomy is respected and their privacy protected.

      ## Understanding

      **Guiding ourselves with reason and a dedication to truth, we champion the pursuit of understanding as the cornerstone of a thriving society.**

      We strive to elevate our collective discourse by encouraging evidence-based thinking and open dialogue. Through exploring the full spectrum of perspectives on complex issues, we resist the pull of echo chambers and tribal thinking. We foster spaces where intellectual honesty flourishes, where questions are encouraged, and where people engage with their capacity for reason, logic, and empathy. By identifying common ground across perceived differences, we build bridges through constructive conversations.

      ## Common Humanity

      **We dedicate ourselves to bringing our shared experiences to the fore, uniting people through common aspirations and our collective human journey.**

      The Common Humanity Coalition celebrates the truths that bind us together beyond our surface differences. We all know the warmth of human connection—whether in a parent's embrace, a friend's steadfast support, or a stranger's unexpected kindness. Each of us understands vulnerability—the racing heart before a challenge, the ache of loss, the comfort needed during illness. We recognize in each other the same capacity for joy, grief, love, and hope that defines our shared human condition. By honouring these deeper connections, we advocate for a society where institutions recognize our common journey, where citizenship transcends artificial divisions, and where we face our collective challenges with the solidarity born of knowing that despite our differences, we navigate this life together, sharing the same fundamental human experience.

    title: Vision
    text: |
      In the Canada we envision—a Canada of tomorrow—we see a society transformed by the recognition of our singular humanity. This is a future where institutions serve all individuals with unique needs, aspirations, and potentials, moving beyond the practice of categorizing people by immutable characteristics.

      In this reimagined Canada, our public institutions assess each person as a complete individual with specific circumstances. Government services are allocated based on demonstrated need, and opportunities flow according to merit and potential. The relationship between people and their institutions is defined by shared community and common purpose—not by arbitrary divisions of birth or biology.

      We see a future where discrimination has been addressed not through further categorization, but by its opposite—a steadfast refusal to sort humans by immutable traits. Our governments, from local councils to Parliament Hill, actively foster unity by celebrating our common experiences: the shared journey of raising families, building communities, and navigating life's challenges. Achievement is recognized based on contribution and character, illuminating the path beyond prejudice through the recognition that labelling itself perpetuates division.

      Our institutions promote policies that honour each person's unique constellation of needs, talents, and dreams. True fairness emerges not from group-based allocations but from understanding and responding to individual circumstances. In this landscape, people in Canada unite around shared aspirations, gathering as neighbours, colleagues, and community members—known by their character, contributions, ideas, and ideals.

      This vision celebrates the rich tapestry of communities that individuals freely choose to form. These self-defined communities—whether religious congregations, professional networks, neighbourhood associations, or cultural groups—emerge organically from individual choice and authentic affinity, strengthening our social fabric through meaningful connections.

      The Common Humanity Coalition works toward this future where institutions serve individuals, where judgments rest on merit and need, and where each person's uniqueness is celebrated through recognition of their distinctive qualities. We seek a Canada where the essential question is never "what group do you belong to?" but rather "who are you, as a person, and how can we ensure you have the opportunity to flourish within the communities you choose?"

      This is our vision—a future of shared belonging, individual dignity, and common humanity.
