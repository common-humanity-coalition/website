<p>On June 18th 2024, the Environment and Climate Change Committee directed staff to implement the American Forests’ Tree Equity Score methodology. At the time the committee seems to not have been aware of the specific details of the methodology.</p>
<p>The present report proposes strengthening the Tree Equity Score by focusing on our shared environmental needs rather than immutable characteristics. This approach recognizes the unique circumstances of each resident while emphasizing our common aspirations for a healthier urban environment. The proposed modification maintains the score’s effectiveness while better reflecting our community’s values of mutual collaboration and collective progress.</p>
<p>When the Tree Equity Score next comes before the committee, I respectfully ask that you direct staff to remove skin colour and race from the methodology.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The Tree Equity Score, as developed by <a href="https://www.treeequityscore.org/methodology">American Forests</a>, is a composite measure that combines tree canopy goals, existing coverage gaps, and a Priority Index to determine areas for tree planting. The Priority Index is a sub-component that incorporates seven equally-weighted indicators to assess community needs, including an indicator that uses census data on skin colour and race. In the city’s implementation, this data comes from the 2021 census question that explicitly asks respondents to categorize themselves by skin colour and race.</p>
<p>The city’s current Urban Forest Management Plan takes a different approach, focusing on environmental and socioeconomic factors without reference to skin colour or race. This established framework has successfully guided Ottawa’s urban forestry decisions to date.</p>

<h1>Downsides of the Current Implementation of the Tree Equity Score</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>promotes race essentialism</strong>
<ul>
<li>The current methodology assumes, without adequate evidence, that skin colour and race are determinative factors in the environmental needs of Ottawa residents.</li>
<li>This approach reinforces outdated notions that different racial groups have inherently different relationships with nature.</li>
<li>Such categorization contradicts modern understanding that environmental needs are universal human concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>divides communities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Using racial classifications in public policy decisions creates artificial divisions.</li>
<li>Environmental benefits of trees transcend racial and ethnic categories.</li>
<li>The current approach risks fragmenting neighborhoods along racial lines rather than uniting them through shared environmental goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>inconsistent with city’s Urban Forest Management Plan</strong>
<ul>
<li>The current methodology represents a significant departure from Ottawa’s established Urban Forest Management Plan.</li>
<li>The Plan emphasizes community cohesion and makes no reference to skin colour or race.</li>
<li>The current approach contradicts the Plan’s approach to equity in urban forestry.</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="benefits-of-removing-skin-colour-and-race-from-the-score" class="section level1">
<h1>Benefits of Removing Skin Colour and Race from the Score</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>united communities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trees provide universal benefits: shade, clean air, and natural beauty for all residents.</li>
<li>Urban forests can serve as gathering spaces where citizens come together as neighbours.</li>
<li>Shared green spaces naturally foster cross-cultural understanding and community connections.</li>
<li>Environmental stewardship can become a common cause that unites Ottawans.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>strengthened civic unity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on socioeconomic and environmental factors emphasizes our common concerns.</li>
<li>Community-based approach to urban forestry reinforces collective place-based responsibility.</li>
<li>Environmental improvements benefit entire neighborhoods regardless of residents immutable characteristics.</li>
<li>Creates opportunities for citizens to work together toward common environmental goals.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="implementation-steps" class="section level1">
<h1>Implementation Steps</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Direct staff to modify the Tree Equity Score calculation by removing the skin colour/race variable from the Priority Index.</li>
<li>Maintain current data collection and analysis for remaining variables.</li>
<li>Apply adjusted formula using 6 factors instead of 7 (see appendix for details).</li>
<li>Require staff to report back to committee on implementation progress and outcomes</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="recommendation-and-path-forward" class="section level1">
<h1>Recommendation and Path Forward</h1>
<p>The Tree Equity Score can be strengthened by removing references to skin colour and race while maintaining its core purpose of identifying high-priority planting areas. This modification aligns with Ottawa’s values of community unity and environmental stewardship. By focusing on socioeconomic and environmental factors, we can create a more effective and unifying approach to urban forest management that brings citizens together rather than dividing them. This change will ensure our urban forestry initiatives continue to build stronger, more connected communities while delivering environmental benefits to Ottawa residents.</p>

<h1>Appendix: Technical Details and additional considerations</h1>
<div id="technical-implementation" class="section level2">
<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
<p>The Tree Equity Score can be modified by adjusting the Priority Index calculation. The current formula, as presented in the American Forests methodology<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E = 0.1 + (1 - 0.1) \cdot \frac{N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 + N_5 + N_6 + N_7}{7}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> through <span class="math inline">\(N_7\)</span> are normalized indicators including the skin colour and race variable. The indicators are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Age: Dependency ratio</li>
<li>Employment: Unemployment rate</li>
<li>Health: Health burden index</li>
<li>Heat Severity: Heat disparity</li>
<li>Income: People in poverty</li>
<li>Language: Linguistic isolation</li>
<li>Race: People of colour</li>
</ol>
<p>The modified formula would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E = 0.1 + (1 - 0.1) \cdot \frac{N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4 + N_5 + N_6}{6}
\]</span></p>
<p>This simple adjustment maintains the mathematical integrity of the index while removing the skin colour and race variable.</p>

<div id="communication-with-city-staff" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication with city staff</h2>
<p>Over the summer of 2024, I engaged in detailed correspondence with several city staff members regarding the Tree Equity Score implementation. Staff were responsive and helpful in addressing questions and providing additional information. Through these exchanges, staff made several key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Staff clarified that while the Tree Equity Score uses Statistics Canada’s “visible minority” data, they view this as distinct from directly using skin colour in calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>Staff indicated they had reviewed the literature and were satisfied that the American Forests Methodology represents best practices for incorporating equity into tree planting programs.</p></li>
<li><p>Staff emphasized that Council has directed implementation of the American Forests methodology as approved at a public committee meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Staff provided academic studies related to neighborhood microclimates and vulnerability to heat stress.</p></li>
<li><p>Staff noted their focus is now on implementation rather than methodology revision, given Council’s direction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In response to these points, I provided detailed analysis of the Census visible minority question and suggested a straightforward mathematical adjustment that would maintain the core objectives while removing the race and skin colour variable. While staff maintained their position on implementing the approved methodology, the exchange helped clarify both the technical and policy considerations at play.</p>
</div>
<div id="skin-colour-and-race-are-used-in-the-tree-equity-score" class="section level2">
<h2>Skin colour and race are used in the Tree Equity Score</h2>
<p>The Tree Equity Score directly incorporates skin colour and race through its Priority Index component. Specifically, one of the seven equally-weighted variables in the Priority Index is the percentage of “people of color” in each neighborhood.</p>
<p>For Ottawa’s implementation, staff will use Statistics Canada’s “visible minority” data from the 2021 Census to populate this variable. Statistics Canada defines “visible minority” in accordance with the Employment Equity Act as “persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This data comes from a Census question that explicitly asked Ottawa residents to categorize themselves by skin colour and race:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is this person:”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>White</li>
<li>South Asian (e.g., East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan)</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Black</li>
<li>Filipino</li>
<li>Arab</li>
<li>Latin American</li>
<li>Southeast Asian (e.g., Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Thai)</li>
<li>West Asian (e.g., Iranian, Afghan)</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Other group—specify</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This explicit use of skin colour and race-based data in the Tree Equity Score raises important considerations about the appropriateness of using immutable characteristics in municipal decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div id="studies-on-race-and-heat-vulnerability" class="section level2">
<h2>Studies on race and heat vulnerability</h2>
<p>Staff have indicated that one of the justifications for including the visible minority data in the Tree Equity Score is because this population tends to be more vulnerable to such hazards as extreme heat, which the urban tree canopy can help to offset. To support this claim, staff provided the following studies:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Neighborhood microclimates and vulnerability to heat stress: <a href="https://keep-dev.lib.asu.edu/system/files/2022-05/microclimates_0_0.pdf" class="uri">https://keep-dev.lib.asu.edu/system/files/2022-05/microclimates_0_0.pdf</a></p></li>

</ol>
<div id="evaluating-evidence-of-causation" class="section level3">
<h3>Evaluating evidence of causation</h3>
<p>To establish that skin colour or race, which underly the definition of “visible minority”, should influence tree planting decisions, the evidence would need to demonstrate one of two causal mechanisms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Biological mechanism:</strong> Evidence that skin colour directly affects an individual’s susceptibility to heat stress through physiological processes like solar radiation absorption or heat retention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discriminatory practices:</strong> Evidence that race-based housing discrimination in Ottawa led to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Systematic placement of visible minorities in areas with less tree cover</li>
<li>Unequal distribution of environmental amenities that mitigate heat</li>
<li>Ongoing patterns of discriminatory development that affect current conditions</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="analysis-of-the-provided-studies" class="section level3">
<h3>Analysis of the provided studies</h3>
<p>The evidence provided by staff falls into two categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Correlation studies</strong> (Studies 1 and 2):
<ul>
<li>Show statistical relationships between demographic characteristics and heat exposure</li>
<li>Do not establish causal mechanisms</li>
<li>Cannot distinguish between correlation and causation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical discrimination studies</strong> (Studies 3 and 4):
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate how housing policies in the United States like redlining created environmental disparities</li>
<li>Show lasting effects of discriminatory practices on urban tree cover</li>
<li>Provide evidence of causal mechanisms through discriminatory policy</li>
<li>Focus exclusively on American cities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>While the historical discrimination studies identify valid causal mechanisms, staff have not provided evidence that similar discriminatory practices shaped Ottawa’s development patterns. If such discrimination existed, it would warrant specific policy interventions to address these historical wrongs. However, adjusting current tree planting formulas based on race and skin colour does not effectively address historical discrimination, particularly without evidence that such discrimination occurred in Ottawa’s development or is occurring today.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="democratic-governance-and-local-authority-in-policy-implementation" class="section level2">
<h2>Democratic Governance and Local Authority in Policy Implementation</h2>
<p>Staff indicated they had reviewed the literature and were satisfied that the American Forests Methodology represents best practices for incorporating equity into tree planting programs.</p>
<p>This appeal to “best practices” raises fundamental concerns about democratic governance. In our system of representative democracy, elected officials, not administrative staff, hold the authority to determine how municipal resources should be allocated. While staff expertise is valuable for implementing policies, core decisions about resource distribution must remain with Council as the democratically elected body representing Ottawa’s citizens.</p>
<p>Different communities have varying priorities and values that shape how they want their tax dollars spent. What works in one jurisdiction may not align with Ottawa’s needs and values. By deferring to external “best practices,” we risk undermining the fundamental principle that citizens, through their elected representatives, should determine how their collective resources are used.</p>
