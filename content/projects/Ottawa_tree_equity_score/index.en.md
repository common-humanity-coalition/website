On June 18th 2024, the city of Ottawa's Environment and Climate Change Committee directed city staff to implement the American Forests' Tree Equity Score methodology. This scoring system combines tree canopy goals, existing coverage gaps, and a Priority Index to determine areas for tree planting. The Priority Index incorporates seven equally-weighted indicators to assess community needs, including an indicator that uses census data on skin colour and race.

The Common Humanity Coalition believes that environmental benefits like shade, clean air, and natural beauty are universal human needs that unite us all. Urban forests serve as gathering spaces where citizens come together as neighbours, fostering cross-cultural understanding and community connections. By focusing on our shared experiences and common aspirations, we can create stronger communities through environmental stewardship that brings people together rather than dividing them based on immutable characteristics.

We are working to strengthen Ottawa's Tree Equity Score by removing the skin colour and race variable while maintaining its core purpose of identifying high-priority planting areas. Here's how we're making this happen:

## 1. Report to the Environment and Climate Change Committee

We have prepared a detailed report titled "Moving Beyond Skin Colour and Race: Strengthening Ottawa's Tree Equity Score" that outlines our concerns and recommendations. The report demonstrates how removing the skin colour and race variable would maintain the score's effectiveness while better aligning with Ottawa's existing policies and community values.

## 2. Committee Delegation

When the Tree Equity Score next comes before the Environment and Climate Change Committee, we will present our perspective through a formal delegation. This will allow us to engage directly with committee members and answer their questions about our proposed modifications to the scoring system.

## 3. Community Engagement

We are helping coalition members connect with their city councillors to share their views on the current approach. By engaging with elected representatives, we ensure that community voices are heard in this important discussion about how environmental benefits should be distributed in our city.

## Help us make a difference

We are looking for volunteers to help us with this project. If you are interested in joining us, please [contact us](/contact).
